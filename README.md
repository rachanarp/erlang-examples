The hello_world folder contains Erlang source files which demonstrate the use of the language.
You can use Eclipse with the Erlang language support. You will also need to install ejabberd.

The contents of hello_world are:

1. hello_world.erl - This program just prints "Hello World" to the output.

2. hello_world_actor.erl - This program shows a receive loop which only breaks if the input is "goobye" (without the quotes)

3. echo.erl - This  program just echoes the input.

4. server.erl - This program demonstrates the Process pattern - tail recursive state handler

5. frequency.erl - This program demonstrates the client-server pattern.
